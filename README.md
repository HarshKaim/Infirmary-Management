# Infirmary-Management
Description of the Project:
Infirmary/Hospitals are essential part of our lives, providing best medical facilities to people suffering from various ailments. It is necessary for the infirmaries/hospitals to keep track of its day-to-day activities and records of their parents, doctors and other tasks like bill generation. In this project we have developed an automated version of the manual system to keep records, named as “Infirmary Management System”.

Objective:
Generally, the project aimed to maintain basic infirmary transactions using a computerized system. It would provide an organized management tool for the infirmary in replacement of the manual system. The sole purpose of the project is to accelerate the management transactions of the infirmary efficiently. Specifically:
1. Create a module that will administer doctor’s information and admission.
2. Create a module that will administer patient’s information and admission.
3. Create a module that will manage bills and payments.
4. Create a module that will manage availability of beds.
